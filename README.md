### Slash
#Overview:

This project aims to classify images of clothes and bags using various deep learning models. The dataset used for this project is collected from the Slash application, and it is available on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/comvisionnn/slash-dataset]. The project involves preprocessing the data, augmenting the dataset due to its small size, building custom models like MobileNet and AlexNet from scratch, and fine-tuning the pre-trained MobileNet model.
